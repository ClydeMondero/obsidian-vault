# Get started with Vim

1. Install Vim and go through all of `vimtutor`, or install Neovim and run `nvim +Tutor`. Repeat until you know it 100%. Complete this _before_ you start to use `vim` as an editor.
    
2. Switch to Vim-like keybindings
    
    1. Continue to use VS Code, but get a Vim-like plugin. There's a neovim plugin that's actually the real neovim embedded.
        
    2. Use Vim/Neovim for general purpose editing, but continue to use VS Code for coding.
        
    3. Commit 100% for at least a week. Do not do any editing in a non-vi editor for that time. Don't use arrow keys. You will be slower, but it's the only way, and at the end of the week you should be 90% as fast as you were before.
        
3. Find a tutorial on how to write a minimal Vim config. Don't mess with Neovim LSP or "distros" until you have more experience.
    
4. After you've gotten comfortable writing a good Vim config, install a plugin manager. I suggest you get a fuzzy finder and install whichkey.
