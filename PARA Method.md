# PARA Method by Tiago Forte
#resource 

A system that told you _exactly_ where to put every piece of information in your life – every document, file, note, agenda, outline, and bit of research – and exactly where to find it when you needed it.

1. **Projects** - are actionable and consists of tasks based on a area with a deadline.
2. **Area** - are long term responsibilities, roles, interests that you can make project out of to.
3. **Resources** - are topics or interests that could be useful in a project or an area in the future.
4. **Archive** - are notes that are inactive, you have no interest or you have finished working with.
